## About This Project

This project is an interactive BB84 quantum key distribution example that teaches users how quantum physics protects communication, where users play as Eve the eavesdropper and try to intercept Alice and Bob's quantum transmission without being detected!

### What is BB84?
The BB84 protocol enables two parties to create a secret key using quantum principles. Alice encodes bits in photon polarization, Bob measures them, and they can detect any eavesdropping by Eve through quantum disturbances in the communication.

## Technical Implementation

This project includes:
- **Interactive BB84 simulation** (`simulation.html`) - Step-by-step BB84 protocol simulation
- **Educational Content** - we explain the content through hands-on interaction.
- **Visual Learning** - See how quantum measurement affects communication security
- **Research Notebook** (`BB84_Final_Project.ipynb`) - Technical implementation details

## Files
- `index.html` - Main website with project overview
- `simulation.html` - Interactive BB84 game
- `css/style.css` - Website styling
- `BB84_Final_Project.ipynb` - Technical research and simulations
